            There are 10 people in this simulation. Each starts out with 10
            dollar. And each will flip a coin. If it's head he will give up 1
            dollar to the person he's trading with, and if tail he will get 1
            dollar from that person. Everyone gets his turn to trade with
            everyone else.If anyone ends up with zero dollar he will be out of
            the trading.

            But as time goes by someone loses more and someone wins more. And
            people who won more they got more chances of staying in the game
            than those who got less money in their pocket. That's why their

            drops their probability of earning money to zero too.

            This simulation only used the probability factor of coin flip. But
            in real life there are many probability factors that add up in 80/20
            rule. Which makes the distribution curve even more accurate to the
            law. It's not always exactly maintaining 80/20 distribution. But
            it's a benchmark. It follows the{" "}
